list of projects


🔮 1. Real-Time Flight Price Predictor

Tech: Python, Scikit-learn or XGBoost, Flask/FastAPI, Docker
Description: Scrape historical flight prices (e.g. via Kaggle datasets) and build a model that predicts whether flight prices will increase or drop.

Bonus: Deploy as a REST API and simulate live user queries.

💰 2. Dynamic Pricing Engine

Tech: Python, SQL, TensorFlow/XGBoost, Streamlit/Power BI

Description: Create a simulation for demand-based pricing. Input features can include time of day, demand, user profile, etc.

Bonus: Implement a "champion vs challenger" A/B model comparison.

🔄 3. Customer Retention Predictor

Tech: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Tableau/Power BI

Description: Use a churn dataset to classify which users are likely to stop using the service.

Bonus: Add SHAP/LIME for model explainability.

✈️ 4. Recommender System for Travel Deals

Tech: Python, NLP, Collaborative Filtering, Streamlit

Description: Build a content-based or collaborative filtering system to suggest flights/hotels based on past bookings or preferences.

📊 5. MLOps Project: Model Deployment Pipeline

Tech: MLflow, Airflow, Docker, GitHub Actions

Description: Demonstrate training, tracking, and deploying a model with full MLOps lifecycle — from data ingestion to API deployment and version control.

📉 6. Time Series Forecasting of Travel Demand

Tech: R/Python, Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM

Description: Forecast daily bookings or travel search trends using real or synthetic data.

Bonus: Create an interactive dashboard to visualize trends and confidence intervals.

🎓 7. "Explain ML to Executives" Project

Tech: Power BI, Tableau, Jupyter Notebooks

Description: Create a project aimed at non-technical stakeholders, showing model results, business KPIs, and how predictions improve ROI.
